FOURIER CIRCLES


HOW TO USE

Run the index.html file in your browser. The right screen is where you can draw anything, and the circles will draw it in the left screen. Use the slider to change the number of circles used to estimate your drawing-- more circles will give a more accurate depiction.


NOTES

Drawings must be a single loop. If the drawing is not a loop, the program will close the loop by adding a straight line from the end point to the start point (this line is shown while you are drawing your sketch as well).

To start a new drawing, just start drawing on the right side and the previous drawing will disappear. Be careful not to start a new drawing if you are still viewing the current one.
